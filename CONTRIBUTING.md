## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Shardy Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to mail@mopsicus.ru.

## I have a question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/mopsicus/shardy-unity/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/mopsicus/shardy-unity/issues/new)
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into
- Provide project and platform versions (unity, android, ios, webgl, etc), depending on what seems relevant

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

A good bug report shouldn’t leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/mopsicus/shardy-unity/issues?q=label%3Abug)
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Unity version
  - Platform target (Android, iOS, WebGL)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Unity client for Shardy, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/mopsicus/shardy-unity/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one
- Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mopsicus/shardy-unity/issues)
- Create new issue
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Shardy users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration
